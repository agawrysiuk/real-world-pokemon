# real-world-pokemon
Fun project with Google Maps API and a GameBoy-classic Pokemon game.

It gets your GPS location to show the map, and rotates in the way your phone is facing.

For the database, it uses Back4App database.

I implemented regular pokemon encounters, catching, getting a list of them or changing the various options of the game (e.g. light/dark mode, music, etc.).

Libraries used: NavController support, SwitchButton, PrettyDialog.

To do: random placing of pokemons (when I get a little more time).
